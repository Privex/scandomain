# Privex CLI Domain Record Scanner

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Privex/scandomain)

A bash tool to make querying multiple record types / multiple domains from the CLI much easier, with the ability to display the records
in several different formats.

This tool wraps `dig`, if you don't have `dig` installed, it's usually available under the package name `bind-tools` or `dnstools` in
most OS package managers.

    ScanDomain tool - A bash tool (wraps 'dig') to make querying multiple record types / domains at once easier
    Copyright (c) 2023    Privex Inc. ( https://www.privex.io )

```

## Quickstart

```sh
# Via wget
wget -O /usr/local/bin/scandomain https://github.com/Privex/scandomain/raw/master/scandomain
# Via curl
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Privex/scandomain/raw/master/scandomain -o /usr/local/bin/scandomain

# Make it executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/scandomain

# Run it :)
scandomain privex.io
scandomain --help
```

## Install

### Dependencies

 - Bash (4.x recommended - standard on Linux systems, not standard on BSD systems)
 - `dig` (can be found in the package `bind-tools` or `dnstools`)

For debian/ubuntu based systems:

```sh
apt update
apt install bind-tools
```

For FreeBSD and some other BSDs:

```sh
pkg install bash bind-tools
```

For macOS:

```sh
brew install bash bind-tools
```

### Install directly into your bin folder using wget/curl

If you're able to write to /usr/local/bin:

```sh
# Via wget
wget -O /usr/local/bin/scandomain https://github.com/Privex/scandomain/raw/master/scandomain
# Via curl
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Privex/scandomain/raw/master/scandomain -o /usr/local/bin/scandomain

# Make it executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/scandomain
```

If you can't / don't want to install globally, you can install it locally into
your `~/.local/bin` folder - just make sure it's in your `PATH`:

```sh
# Via wget
wget -O ~/.local/bin/scandomain https://github.com/Privex/scandomain/raw/master/scandomain
# Via curl
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Privex/scandomain/raw/master/scandomain -o ~/.local/bin/scandomain

# Make it executable
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/scandomain
```

### Install by cloning the Git repo

Alternatively, if you prefer, you can clone the repo and install from the cloned Git repo instead.

This may be helpful if you want to use a specific tag, make it easier to update in the future
using `git pull`, or so you have the README and LICENSE on hand locally :)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Privex/scandomain.git
cd scandomin

# If you're able to write to /usr/local/bin
install scandomain /usr/local/bin/

# If you can't / don't want to install globally, you can install it locally into
# your ~/.local/bin folder - just make sure it's in your PATH
install scandomain ~/.local/bin/

# If you don't have the 'install' command, you can simply cp it, just make
# sure to chmod +x it
cp -v scandomain /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/scandomain
# Or install into your user bin folder:
cp -v scandomain ~/.local/bin/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/scandomain

# Alternatively, you can run it straight from the repo folder!
./scandomain example.com
./scandomain --help
```
